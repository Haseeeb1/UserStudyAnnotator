# User Study Annotator
A minimal, hackable annotator for user studies. Originally created for [_SAMoSA_ (IMWUT/Ubicomp 2022)](https://vimal-mollyn.com/research/samosa-sensing-activities-with-motion-and-sub-sampled-audio/).

## What's it good for?
Anytime you need to manually annotate user sensor data. For example, IMU data from smartwatches, smartphones, etc. This tool will log unix timestamps to a csv, which can later be synced to sensor data.

### How does it work?
The tool randomly presents an activity and context, given a set of [contexts with corresponding activities](static/activity_list.json). First, a context is chosen at random, and then the trials of all the activities pertaining to that context are randomized. For example, in the workshop context, the 15 trials (5 activities Ã— 3 repetitions per activity) are presented in a random order. 

### Features
- Redo Trials - You (the experimenter) will inevitably make a mistake! 
- Save progress - user study progress is stored in `study_data/pid/p_state.json`, so you can restart whenever you want to!
- Timer - in order to make sure you collect enough data! :D

## How to use?

### Install dependencies
Tested with `python3.8`
```
flask
```

### 1. Run
```
python app.py 
```

### 2. Enter a participant ID
Make sure it's a number - this is used as the random seed!

## I want a different set of labels
Modify `static/activity_list.json`.
